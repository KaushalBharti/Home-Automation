# Home-Automation
I have developed a Home Automation Project within the realm of Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT). 
This project employs a NodeMcu microcontroller, various sensors, and actuators. The system allows control of home appliances through the Blynk mobile app and Google Voice Assistant on any Android device. Key features of this project include:  
1. Smart Lights
2.  Automatic Garage Door
3. Day and Night Automatic On/Off Lights
4.  Temperature and Humidity Display
